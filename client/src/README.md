If you are not sure how to use react, please look at some of the skeleton code

src/App.js: 
    contains all the components in the app
    Also contains the router that allows pages to be switched

src/pages/ExamplePage.js
    Contains an example page for the application

src/components/examples 
    contains some example components used in the ExamplePage.js
    Also contains an example of how a get request (through express) could be used to get some info from the backend
